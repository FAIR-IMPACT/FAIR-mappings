# Requirements for FAIR mappings
## Executive summary

## Introduction

## The Recommendations
To formulate these recommendations, we initially conceptually divided the domain of mapping and crosswalks into four parts, as described in TODO. The recommendations were formulated based on brainstorming sessions focusing on each part using gathered community requirements and feedback collected during various events. This collaborative approach allowed us to involve our collective insights and perspectives and the community, ensuring a comprehensive and inclusive foundation for the recommendations.
